### Analysis
# The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, 
# against the other treatment regimens. 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumours, were given a range of drug 
# regimens including Capomulin. £Over the course of 45 days, tumour development was observed and measured 
# and captured. 

# In order to provide the technical report for the clinical study, the data had to ordered and sorted to generate summary 
# statistics from which several charts were produced to facilitate the review.

# From the analysis undertaken the following observations can be made:

#     1 - The Capomulin treatment regimen appears to be an effective treatment in the reduction of SSC tumours in mice when 
#         compared to other treatment regimens when noting the reduction of tumour volume over time.

#     2 - While Capomulin has performed well in the study, Ramicane has performed equally if not slightly better than
#         Capomulin when assessing the final tumour volume at the last day of the study. It is worth noting that less mice 
#         received the Ramicane regimen when compared to Capomulin thus it could have an impact on the analysis for Ramicane - 
#         further analysis may be needed.

#     3 - There is a strong correlation between the weight of the mice and the average tumour volume for the Capomulin
#         treatment regimen which should be taken into consideration for future studies.

#     4 - The is analysis suggests that Capomulin treatment reduces tumour volume between 5 to 26 days however it was noted
#         that tumour volume the increases again from days 30 to 45. Further analysis will be required.
